Addtional Stuff
----------------------------------------------
- When using playmats, you can choose a custom playmat instead of the default 'wsplaymat.jpg'.
- Cardbacks can also be modified to make it look as though one is using sleeves. 
  Simply select an image and shift it to plugins/ws/sets/setimages/general and rename the image to 'cardback.jpg'.
  (Note: Apparently, LackeyCCG takes the image in the 'general' folder over the one in 'setimages', so there is no need to replace the one in 'setimages'.
   Furthermore, updating will undo all changes made as it will always replace cardback.jpg in setimages when the plugin is updated.
   Note2 (IMPORTANT): If you change the image, take note to use an image with the same size.)
