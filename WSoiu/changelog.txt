v1.104a

v1.104
----------------------------------------------
NJWE11		- Nichijou (Daily Life) EP added

v1.103
----------------------------------------------
Sort of, kind of, maybe New Year's gift
DDWE12		- Dog Days EP added
DD TD NOT added
Note:	Since this is a pre-release Dog Days EP, stuff might happen, so this is a very temporary release and may be subject to change.
		All in all, when the actual Dog Days EP is released, images will be improved, TD will be released, etc, etc, can't be bothered, have fun.

v1.102
----------------------------------------------
MKSE11		- Milky Holmes: Counterattack of Genius4 added

v1.101
----------------------------------------------
FTSE10		- Fairy Tail Extra Pack added

v1.100
----------------------------------------------
NEARING COMPLETION OF ALL SERIES
ID/RGW13	- To Aru Majutsu Index/Railgun 2 added
IMS04		- The IDOLM@STER added
MFS13		- Macross Frontier added

Assorted TDs added
GCS16		- Guilty Crown TD added
FZS17		- Fate/zero TD added
P4SE12		- Persona 4 Animation TD added
Note:
	User interface related stuff:
		Combined 'Trait1' and 'Trait2' into a general 'Traits' for easier searching
		Added a 'Stand All' button
		Added Flavour text
			All normal cards for most series have translated flavour text.
			Almost all PRs and foils do not, unless they are the same as normal, in which it is reflected
				Those that do have come about as a result of Google Translate and amateur translators on the team.
		Double click once now turns card to REST instead of REVERSE (though in opposite direction, meaning climaxes in REST would be upside down), leading to...
		Climaxes are now all turned to REST by default. Update should delete all previous climax images and they should be redownloaded
		Modified the names and abilities of all the cards in Lucky Star (they are now easier on the eye). 
		Same for Shining Force EXA
	The following missing cards do not have images and thus, errors are to be expected:
		RGW13-107	PR
		RGW13-108	PR
		IDW13-112	PR
		DGSE08-49	PR
		DGSE08-50	PR
		MKSE09-31	PR
	Last thing: Some of the cards have been renamed a little, so, decklists should be rechecked.

v1.055
----------------------------------------------
SBS06 - Sengoku Basara added
SBSE05 - Sengoku Basara EP added
SB TD added
Note: Sengoku Basara as a series is very loosely translated, mostly due to the fact that there is no 'official' fan translation to base on and that none of us have actually watched Sengoku Basara before. Should anyone find any fault with the way the names are translated, you may email me the card number and what you think is a better translation
Note2: Anything in Sengoku Basara with "Demon King" is the same as Disgaea's "Overlord" and vice versa. This means that cards that support Sengoku Basara's "Demon King" can also be used to support Disgaea's "Overlord" and vice versa.
